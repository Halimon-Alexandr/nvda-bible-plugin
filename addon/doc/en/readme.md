Welcome to our appعour reliable assistant in studying the Word of God!  
Bible is a tool designed for working with the texts of the Holy Scriptures.  
However, unlike most similar programs, our app offers a fully accessible interface optimized for non-visual access.  
It has three main windows:  

1. **Main Window** -for selecting a book, chapter, and translation.  
2. **Search Window** -for quickly finding specific words or phrases in the text.  
3. **Go-to Verse Window** -for opening a specific verse either in the main program window or the navigation window.  

The program window can be opened using the **NVDA+X** keyboard shortcut.  

### Main Window  

The main window contains four key elements: a large text field displaying the Bible text (occupying most of the screen) and three dropdown lists for selecting the book, chapter, and translation. The text field shows the selected Bible passage according to the chosen parameters. The window title always displays the name of the selected book, chapter number, and current translation, helping users quickly orient themselves within the app.  

#### Keyboard Shortcuts for Text Navigation  

Standard cursor keys are used for text navigation. The **Ctrl+PageDown** and **Ctrl+PageUp** keys move the cursor 10 verses forward or backward, respectively. Similarly, **PageDown** and **PageUp** move the cursor 5 verses forward or backward.  

Pressing any digit in the text field moves the cursor to the corresponding verse. To navigate to a two-digit verse (e.g., 12 or 45), quickly press the respective keys on the keyboard.  

#### Switching Between Elements in the Main Window  

Use **Tab** and **Shift+Tab** to switch between elements in the main window. The **Tab** key moves focus to the next element, while **Shift+Tab** returns to the previous one. This allows seamless navigation between the Bible text field and the dropdown lists for book, chapter, and translation selection.  

#### Other Keyboard Shortcuts  

- **Ctrl+F** -Opens the Bible search window to find verses by word or phrase.  
- **Ctrl+L** -Opens the "Go-to Verse" window, where you can enter a verse reference and jump directly to it.  
- **Closing Windows** -All app windows can be closed using **Alt+F4** or **Esc**.  

### Search Window  

The search window offers more controls than the main window, enabling flexible text searches within the Bible.  

#### Controls:  
- **Results Text Field** -Displays search results after entering a query.  
- **Search Query Field** -Stores the last 10 queries for quick access.  
- **Search Category Dropdown** -Available categories: "All Books," "None of the Books," "Old Testament Books," "New Testament Books." Selecting a category automatically marks the corresponding group of books in the book list.  
- **Bible Book Dropdown** -Allows selecting specific books for the search. By default, the number of selected books depends on the chosen category.  

#### Additional Search Options:  
- **Checkboxes for Search Options:**  
  - **Whole Word Search** -Searches for exact word matches.  
  - **Case-Sensitive** -Enables case sensitivity.  
  - **Regular Expression** -Allows using regex for advanced searches.  
- **"Search" Button** -Initiates the search. Pressing **Enter** in the query field also starts the search.  

#### Additional Features:  
- Pressing **Enter** on a selected result opens the text in the main window and closes the search window.  
- The search window can also be closed using **Alt+F4** or **Esc**.  

### Go-to Verse Window  

The "Go-to Verse" window opens with **Ctrl+L** and includes:  

- **Verse Display Field** -Shows the found verse or passage based on settings.  
- **Verse Reference Field** -Accepts verse references in abbreviated form. Stores the last 10 references for quick access.  
- **Verse Display Checkbox** -Choose whether to display the verse in the current window or the main window.  
- **"OK" and "Cancel" Buttons** -"OK" opens the selected verse, while "Cancel" closes the window without searching.  

The window can also be closed with **Alt+F4** or **Esc**.  

- Both Eastern (e.g., "Jn. 3:16") and Western ("Jn 3, 16") reference formats are accepted.  
- Unchecking "Open in Main Window" allows specifying a verse range (e.g., "Jn. 3:16ֲ0").
