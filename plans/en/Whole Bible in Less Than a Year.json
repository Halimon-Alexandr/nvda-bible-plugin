You’ll follow the Old Testament chronologically, with the Psalms and prophets intermingled as they fit with the history. Every day includes a passage from the New Testament to show how the Bible is one story pointing to Jesus. Every seventh day is a pause to reflect on what you’re learning.",

One of the best ways to keep going all the way to the end is to find a friend or two who want to do the same Plan at the same time. Who could you invite to join you on this journey? You can read together using Plans With Friends here in the YouVersion Bible App, or you can read separately and talk to each other once a week about what you read.\nAs you get ready to read today, ask God to reveal something to you. Take note of any promises to trust, commands to obey, truths to embrace, warnings to heed, or any encouragement to rest in. You can make notes of those within the Bible App, or you might consider having a journal to record your thoughts. After you read today’s Scriptures, here are two questions to pause and reflect on:\nWhat do you learn about God, about yourself, or about the world?\nIs there one verse or thought that stands out to you today? Talk to God about it.",

It’s similar to this one, except it follows the New Testament chronologically instead of the Old Testament.
