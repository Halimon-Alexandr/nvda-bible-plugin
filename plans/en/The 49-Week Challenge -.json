One of the best ways to keep going all the way to the end is to find a friend or two who want to do the same Plan at the same time. Who could you invite to join you on this journey? You can read together using Plans With Friends here in the YouVersion Bible App, or you can read separately and talk to each other once a week about what you read.\nAs you get ready to read today, ask God to reveal something to you. Take note of any promises to trust, commands to obey, truths to embrace, warnings to heed, or any encouragement to rest in. You can make notes of those within the Bible App, or you might consider having a journal to record your thoughts. After you read today’s Scriptures, here are two questions to pause and reflect on:\nWhat do you learn about God, about yourself, or about the world?\nIs there one verse or thought that stands out to you today? Talk to God about it.",

What did you learn in this year of listening to God in His Word? Share it with someone to encourage them to get to know God better through His Word.\nIf you want an idea of another annual Plan to try next, take a look at the Plan called\nWhole Bible in Less Than a Year\n. It’s similar to this one, except it follows the Old Testament chronologically instead of the New Testament. If you want a slower pace that still takes you through the whole Bible, you can try the Plan called\nWhole Bible in Under 2 Years\n.",
